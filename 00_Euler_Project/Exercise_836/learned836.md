# Explain the concepts

## Question statement
Let A be an affine plane over a radically integral local field F with residual characteristic p.

We consider an open oriented line section U of A with normalized Haar measure m.

Define f(m, p) as the maximal possible discriminant of the jacobian associated to the orthogonal kernel embedding of U into A.

Find f(20230401, 57). Give as your answer the concatenation of the first letters of each bolded word. */


# Afine plane   
*Explanation:* 
 - For any two distinct points, there is a single line that passes through both of them.

 - Each line contains at least two points.

 - There are three points that are not all on the same line.

 - If two lines are parallel to a third line, then they are parallel to each other.

## Local Field

In mathematics, a field K is called a (non-Archimedean) local field if it is complete with respect to a topology induced by a discrete valuation v and if its residue field k is finite.

**QUESTIONS:**

1. What's discrete valuation v?

    In mathematics, a *discrete valuation* is an *integer valuation* on a field $K$; that is, a function:

    $$
    \nu: K \to \mathbb{Z} \cup \{\infty\}
    $$

    satisfying the conditions:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    &\nu(x \cdot y) = \nu(x) + \nu(y) \\
    &\nu(x + y) \geq \min \{\nu(x), \nu(y)\} \\
    &\nu(x) = \infty \iff x = 0
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    for all $x, y \in K$.
